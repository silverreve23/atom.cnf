It's a dark syntax theme crafted especially for [Atom](http://atom.io), with subtle colors that are meant to be easy on the eyes. It is mean to be paired with [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) (though this is hardly a requirement).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### **Please Note:** This is the Seti syntax theme for [Atom](http://atom.io) only\n\nThis is for the _syntax_ (i.e. code view) of the Atom editor. I also have [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) for theming the _interface_ in Atom.\n\nIf you're not in the market for an Atom theme, you can have a look at one of these great ports for other platforms:\n\n+ [Emacs](https://github.com/caisah/seti-theme)\n+ [iTerm](https://github.com/willmanduffy/seti-iterm)\n+ [JetBrains](https://github.com/zchee/Seti_JetBrains)\n+ [Sublime Text 3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Seti_UI)\n+ [Vim](https://github.com/trusktr/seti.vim)\n+ [Hyper](https://github.com/unluisco/hyperseti)\n\n-----\n\n## What's New? 1.0 Update\nSeti has reached 1.0, and it now integrates more tightly with Seti UI. There is also a new settings interface that allows you to select a base color theme.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax/raw/1.0-beta/screenshot.png)\n\n-----\n\n## Settings\n_To get here, Go to \"Atom > Preferences\" Select \"Themes\"  and click the settings icon next to \"Seti\" under Syntax Theme dropdown_\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax/raw/1.0-beta/screenshot-settings.png)\n\nYou can choose to have the syntax theme automatically adjust to match your selected theme in Seti UI (default), or select one of the built in themes.\n\n_Please note this is some-what of a beta feature. The default blue theme has been pretty well tested, but the other colors are still being tweaked. Keep an eye out for updates, and please file a bug if you notice anything weird._\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax/raw/1.0-beta/screenshot-colors.png)\n\n-----\n\n### Custom Icons\n[ ![Screenshot](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax/raw/1.0-beta/_icons/circular/circular-128x128.png) ](_icons/circular/)\n[ ![Screenshot](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax/raw/1.0-beta/_icons/rounded/rounded-128x128.png) ](_icons/rounded/)\n[ ![Screenshot](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax/raw/1.0-beta/_icons/squared/squared-128x128.png) ](_icons/squared/)\n",
