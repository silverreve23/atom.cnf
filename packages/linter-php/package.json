As\nsuch, the [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package will be installed\nautomatically for you if it isn't already installed. This will provide the user interface and run the linter for you._\n\n### Setup\nOnce the package is installed you may need to specify the path to the `php`\nexecutable if Atom is not able to find it automatically. You can do this from\nAtom's settings menu or by editing your `~/.atom/config.cson` file (choose Open Your Config in Atom's menu). If editing the file by hand you should modify/create a\nsection like the following:\n```cson\n'linter-php':\n  # php path. run 'which php' to find the path\n  'executablePath': /usr/bin/php\n```\n_Additional settings can be found in the consumer of your linter providers, typically this is the [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package automatically installed with `linter-php`. Global settings like linting delay must be adjusted here._\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThe following people have stepped up to take responsibility for this repository and should be consulted on any releases or major changes.\n\n* [steelbrain](http://github.com/steelbrain) - Release Maintainer\n* [Arcanemagus](http://github.com/Arcanemagus)\n",
